Running:
  python3 pnl.py <prices file> <fills file>

Assumptions:
  Prices file is correctly formatted and only contains price updates.
  Fills file is correctly formatted and only contains fill messages.
  Both passed in files exist.
  Fill orders are given precedence over price updates.
    Meaning if a fill order and a price update come at the same time
    the fill order will be executed first, then the pnl will be printed.

Inner workings:
  Read both files and generate a stream of messages in chronological order.
    Fill orders are given precedence.

  Process each message in chronological order, and maintain the running sum
  of quantity and total money spent for each position.
